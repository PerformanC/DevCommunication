# DevCommunication
Dev ignores you? hate you? Or see you as a troublesome person? This book will help you that.

## Preface

Sometimes you wonder why.... **Why developers are too slow to fix this issue.** Or **why developers ignores my question.......**

That's so sad, isn't it?

But hey, you don't have to be sad because <u>**very rarely**</u> does this awkward situation happen because they really hate you. But most of the time it's because you don't know <u>**how to describe the issue**</u> and <u>**talk**</u> to them.

It makes them <u>**confused**</u> and even <u>**hate you**</u> because they have <u>**been asked**</u> the <u>**same type of question over and over again**</u>.

<u>So how can I communicate with developers, I can't understand them???</u> Most of developers hate misinformation or something similar like that. So this book will help you that

Last words before go the the main point, I want to say thanks for reading this book and hope you can learn something new here.
